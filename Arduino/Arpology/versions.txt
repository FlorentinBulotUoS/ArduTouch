Versions:

   0.62  top pot in ARPEG_FRAME selects pattern
   0.61  loading of pending pattern is synchronized with pattern start
   0.60  pendingPattern renamed pendingPatNum
         add currentPatNum
         add display of currentPatNum to ArpSynth info
   0.59  move setRate() from Strobe to ArpSynth
         setRate() uses 3 logarithmic zones with emphasis on "sweet" zone
   0.58  pendingPattern replaces selectPattern()
   0.57  patterns[] is 1 based (element 0 is NULL)
   0.56  revert to 0.53
         9 patterns
   0.55  add boolean arpegForward
         add logic for playing patterns backwards 
   0.54  patterns[] is 1 based (element 0 is NULL)
         7 patterns
   0.53  add ArpSynth('p')
         6 patterns
   0.52  add ArpSynth::selectPattern()
   0.51  add structure for appegiation patterns
         pattern0 replicates prior hardcoded logic
         setup() inits ArpSynth::pattern to pattern0
   0.50  add Strobe::setRate() sets freq semi-logarithmically
         pot1 controls arpeggiation rate
         [26282 / 903]
   0.49  add Frame typedef
         add ArpSynth::selectFrame()
   0.48  BUT0_PRESS no longer sets majorTonality
         BUT1_PRESS no longer sets minorTonality
         BUT1_DTAP toggles tonality
         [Note: had to intercept META_ONESHOT events b/c of PLAYTHRU setting]
         [26088 / 902]
   0.47  move all set envelope methods from ArpSynth to QuadSynth
         [26076 / 902]
   0.46  fix to broken tonality switching
         ArpSynth::setTonality() no longer calls reTrigger()
         [26076 / 902]
   0.45  remove redundant init of release times in setup macro
         --- changing tonality is broken
         [26130 / 902]
   0.44  copied from Modalia [0.44] and remonikered
         [26162 / 908]
