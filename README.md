# ArduTouch
ArduTouch is an Arduino-compatible music synthesizer kit.  
Build it, and it works!  
Way low cost (target price per kit is $25.)  
It comes with a pre-programmed music synthesizer that makes way cool sounds and music and noise.

Coming soon:
An ArduTouch library is available for programming in more super nice synthesizer features.  
For those who want to learn more, the documentation teaches the basics of Digital Signal Processing for audio generation.
